Romana on Kubernetes
====================

Installation
------------

Installing Romana on a Kubernetes cluster is fast and easy.

For clusters created with ``kops`` or ``kubeadm`` with default settings,
predefined YAML files are provided that you can install using
``kubectl apply``. Some changes to the YAML files will be required under
some circumstances - check the special notes below.

If you have made your own customized installation of Kubernetes or used
a different tool to create the cluster, then you should refer to the
detailed `components <components.md>`__ page, and align the example
configuration with the details specific to your cluster.

Installation using kubeadm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the guide for `Using kubeadm to Create a
Cluster <https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/#instructions>`__,
and complete steps 1 and 2. Then, to install Romana, run

.. code:: bash

    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romana/romana/master/docs/kubernetes/romana-kubeadm.yml

Please see special notes below if - you are using a non-default range
for Kubernetes Service IPs - want to specify your own IP range for Pod
IPs - are running in virtualbox - have cluster nodes in multiple subnets

Installation with kops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**NOTE:** These instructions will change in the near future, when Romana
is added as a built-in networking option in ``kops``.

When creating your `kops
cluster <https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/aws.md>`__,
use the ``--networking cni`` option. You will need to SSH directly to
your master node to install Romana and have the rest of the cluster
finish launching.

.. code:: bash

    # Connect to the master node
    ssh admin@master-ip
    # Check that Kubernetes is running and that the master is in NotReady state
    kubectl get nodes

You should see output similar to the below example.

::

    NAME                                          STATUS            AGE       VERSION
    ip-172-20-xx-xxx.us-west-2.compute.internal   NotReady,master   2m        v1.7.0

Then, to install Romana, run

.. code:: bash

    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romana/romana/master/docs/kubernetes/romana-kops.yml

It will take a few minutes for the master node to become ready, launch
deployments, and for other minion nodes to register and activate.

You will also need to open port 4001 in the AWS Security Group for your
"masters" instances. This can be edited in the AWS EC2 Management
Console. Edit the rule for TCP Ports 1-4000 from "nodes", and change the
range to 1-4001.

The install for kops provides two additional components: - romana-aws: A
tool that automatically configures EC2 Source-Dest-Check attributes for
nodes in your Kubernetes cluster - romana-vpcrouter: A service that
populates your cluster's VPC Routing tables with routes between AZs.

Please see special notes below if - you are using a non-default range
for Kubernetes Service IPs - want to specify your own IP range for Pod
IPs

Installation in other environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to the detailed `components <components>`__ page, and
align the example configuration with the details specific to your
cluster.

Updates coming soon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These topics still need additional explanation, instructions and guides.
