Route Publisher Add-on
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Kubernetes clusters installed in datacenters, it is useful to enable
the Romana Route Publisher add-on. It is used to automatically announce
routes for Romana addresses to your BGP- or OSPF-enabled router,
removing the need to configure these manually.

Because the routes are for prefixes instead of precise /32 endpoint
addresses, the rate and volume of routes to publish is reduced.

Configuration
-------------

The Romana Route Publisher uses `BIRD <http://bird.network.cz/>`__ to
announce routes from the node to other network elements. Configuration
is separated into two parts:

-  a static ``bird.conf`` to describe the basic configuration of BIRD,
   ending with an ``include``
-  a dynamic ``publisher.conf`` that is used to generate a config
   containing routes for Romana addresses

When the pod first launches, BIRD is launched using the static
configuration. Then, when new blocks of Romana addreses are allocated to
a node, the dynamic configuration is generated with routes for those
blocks, and BIRD is given a signal to reload its configuration.

If your configuration requires custom configuration per-node or
per-subnet, there is a naming convention for the files that can be used
to support this.

Both config files will look for a "best match" extension to the name
first. When loading ``x.conf`` on a node with IP ``192.168.20.30/24``,
it will first look for:

-  ``x.conf.192.168.20.30`` (IP suffix for node-specific config)
-  ``x.conf.192.168.20.0`` (Network address suffix, for subnet-specific
   config)
-  ``x.conf``

Examples
--------

**bird.conf (for both BGP and OSPF)**


::

    router id from 192.168.0.0/16;

    protocol kernel {
        scan time 60;
        import none;
            export all;
    }

    protocol device {
        scan time 60;
    }

    include "conf.d/*.conf";

-  Make sure the CIDR specified for ``router id`` matches your cluster
   nodes.
-  The ``protocol kernel`` and ``protocol device`` can be modified, or
   just deleted if not necessary.
-  Add any additional, global BIRD configuration to this file (eg:
   debugging, timeouts, etc)
-  The ``include`` line is the hook to load the generated dynamic
   config. It should be in your ``bird.conf`` exactly as specified.

**publisher.conf for OSPF**


::

    protocol static romana_routes {
        {{range .Networks}}
        route {{.}} reject;
        {{end}}
    }

    protocol ospf OSPF {
      export where proto = "romana_routes";
      area 0.0.0.0 {
        interface "eth0" {
          type broadcast;
        };
      };
    }

-  The first section, ``protocol static static_bgp`` is used by the
   ``romana-route-publisher`` to generate a dynamic config.
-  The second section, ``protocol ospf OSPF`` should contain the
   ``export`` entry, and ``area`` blocks to match your environment.
-  The interface names will need to be modified to match the node's
   actual interfaces
-  Add any additional, protocol-specific BIRD configuration to this file

**publisher.conf for BGP**


::

    protocol static romana_routes {
        {{range .Networks}}
        route {{.}} reject;
        {{end}}
    }

    protocol bgp BGP {
        export where proto = "romana_routes";
            direct;
        local as {{.LocalAS}};
        neighbor 192.168.20.1 as {{.LocalAS}};
    }

-  The first section, ``protocol static static_bgp`` is used by the
   ``romana-route-publisher`` to generate a dynamic config.
-  The second section, ``protocol bgp BGP`` should be changed to match
   your specific BGP configuration.
-  Add any additional, protocol-specific BIRD configuration to this file
-  The ``neighbor`` address will likely be different for each subnet. To
   handle this, you can use multiple ``publisher.conf`` files with the
   appropriate network address suffixes, eg:

 -  bird.conf.192.168.20.0
 -  bird.conf.192.168.35.0

Installation
------------

First, the configuration files need to be loaded into a ``configmap``.

1) Put all the files into a single directory
2) ``cd`` to that directory
3) Run
   ``kubectl -n kube-system create configmap route-publisher-config --from-file=.``
   (the ``.`` indicates the current directory)

Next, download the YAML file from
`here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romana/romana/master/docs/kubernetes/specs/romana-route-publisher.yaml>`__
to your master node.

Then, load the Romana Route Publisher add-on by running this command on
your master node.

::

    kubectl apply -f romana-route-publisher.yaml

Verification
------------

Check that route publisher pods are running correctly

::

    $ kubectl -n kube-system get pods --selector=romana-app=route-publisher
    NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    romana-route-publisher-22rjh   2/2       Running   0          1d
    romana-route-publisher-x5f9g   2/2       Running   0          1d

Check the logs of the bird container inside the pods

::

    $ kubectl -n kube-system logs romana-route-publisher-22rjh bird
    Launching BIRD
    bird: Chosen router ID 192.168.XX.YY according to interface XXXX
    bird: Started

Check the logs of the publisher container inside the pods

These are normal, even if OSPF is being used.
