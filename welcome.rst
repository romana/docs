Welcome to Romana
=================

Romana is a network and security automation solution for cloud native
applications.

-  Romana automates the creation of isolated cloud native networks and
   secures applications with a distributed firewall that applies access
   control policies consistently across all endpoints (pods or VMs) and
   services, wherever they run.
-  Through Romana's topology aware IPAM, endpoints receive natively
   routable addresses: No overlays or tunnels are required, increasing
   performance and providing operational simplicity.
-  Because IP addresses are assigned with network topology in mind,
   routes within the network are highly aggregated, reducing the impact
   on networking hardware, and allowing more secure configurations.
-  Supports Kubernetes and OpenStack clusters, on premise or on AWS.
